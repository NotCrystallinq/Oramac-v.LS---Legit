# Oramac-v.LS---Legit
A hack client base with toggle sprint and fullbright. No actual hacks included in this one it is just made to be legit bcs I refuse to play on any other version than 1.8.x


To use the client type "%appdata% into the windows search bar and got to ".minecraft" and then drag and drop this file into the versions folder.

Current issues:
- has some entity rendering problems while playing bedwars (not sure if its server side or client side tho)
- the title screen client name renders offscreen on laptops but renders fine on PC monitors
