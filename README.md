# Oramac-v.LS---Legit
A hack client base with toggle sprint and fullbright. No actual hacks included in this one it is just made to be legit bcs I refuse to play on any other version than 1.8.x

best used with this texture pack "https://minecraft-resourcepacks.com/download/war-v2-pvp/" (not made by me) because otherwise the text looks like shit. Oramac v.LT will hopefully have a custom font renderer so that the font isnt shit and Oramac v.1LT will probably have the option to have any font you want if you have the .ttf file to add it.

To use the client unzip this folder and drag the folder that says Oramac v.LS - Legit (not the one that says "Oramac-v.LS---Legit-main") then
  type "%appdata% into the windows search bar and got to ".minecraft" and then drag and drop that file into the versions folder.

Current issues:
- has some entity rendering problems while playing bedwars (not sure if its server side or client side though)
- the title screen client name renders offscreen on laptops but renders fine on PC monitors
